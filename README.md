While living in Belgium I mostly worked with Moroccans and ate a lot of their food. Berbers are the most populated among all Muslims in Europe. They are very gentle and good hosts as well who feed the guests at home. The ordinary Morocco food is extremely plain and less spicy but it is tasty and I love it because I also like less peppery meals. Their top traditional recipes which they offer at weddings and any small or big events are Couscous, Bastilla, Tagine, Mint Tea, Harira, Fish Chermoula, and samolina loaf.
 Couscous
Couscous is a grain that can also be cooked with heat
